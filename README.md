## General
Veracode partners with companies that innovate through software to confidently deliver secure code on time. Veracode addresses common Application Security challenges with a unique combination of automated application analysis in the pipeline, plus DevSecOps expertise for developers and security professionals, all delivered through a scalable SaaS platform.

Veracode for Jenkins is a plugin that automates the submission of applications to Veracode for scanning, packaging it in Veracode's preferred format. Veracode for Jenkins contributes a "Post-Build" action that can be used to configure jobs to scan your own source code (SAST) or open source libraries (SCA) as well as testing running applications with dynamic analysis (DAST) or interactive application security testing (IAST).
